At the last meeting we decided to do something a little different for the December meeting as an experiment. Instead of all reading the same book, we chose a theme - in this case <em>Christmas</em>. Everyone is to read a book of their choice, based on that theme. It can be fiction, non-fiction, graphic, comic, cookery book, text book, ...  You then come prepared to persuade the group that your book is worth reading (or not if it turns out to be rubbish!). We thought that this sounded like fun and has worked in other book groups we know of.
