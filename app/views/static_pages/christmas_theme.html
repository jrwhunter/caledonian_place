The book is about a man called Lou who is extremely wealthy & successful, lives in Dublin and whose life revolves around his work.  He is married with two young children but spends no time with them or his parents/siblings, preferring to work and chase after other women.  He takes pity on a homeless man called Gabe and gets him a job at his company.  The story shows what a selfish person Lou has become over the years and Gabe gradually becomes involved with many parts of Lou's life, much to Lou's annoyance.  Gabe offers Lou the chance to clone himself with a special pill so he can spend time with his family and also do all the fun/work things he normally likes to do.  This leads to Lou realising what he has been missing with his family and the story concludes with revealing the real reason why Gabe came into Lou's life.

It's interesting that of the 3779 verses in the four gospels combined, only 33 present the Christmas story. It is in the first 21 verses of the second chapter of St Luke, and there alone, that we find an account of the nativity story as we recognise it, complete with the decree of taxation from CÃ¦sar Augustus, the journey to Bethlehem of the unmarried and expectant couple, the overcrowded inn, the stable, the appearance of angels to shepherds on the hillside and the virgin birth itself. St Matthew assumes the nativity to have happened without actually mentioning it, and tells of the journey and subsequent adoration of the Magi, and the anxiousness and actions of King Herod. Luke 2:14 contains words that have been used extensively by composers of choral works: "Glory to God in the Highest" or in Latin: "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" and I played excerpts from Handel's Messiah and Bach's B Minor Mass.
